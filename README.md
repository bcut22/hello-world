# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub!
I have always wanted to learn to code and program. I went a different direction after high school, but now, at 33, I am beginning to realize that I won't have forever to chase my dreams. I'd better learn what I want to now, so that I won't look back and regret that I never gave it my best shot. Here goes nothing!
